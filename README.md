# Project Summary 
The project includes the following classes:
﻿﻿**SchoolManagementSystem**: 
Represents a school that encloses all the various methods Into one entity; gathering of information by the user; serves purpose of academic, classification and management of information in different classes  such as : 
﻿﻿**Department**: Class, Represents the  departments within the school system
**findDepartment**: retrieving or searching for information about a department in a system, including looking up a department by its name or 
**addDepartment**: adding a new department to a system or application involving creating a new department object, setting its properties, and adding it to the system.
**printDepartments**:Grabs collection of the department class and print information 
﻿﻿**Student**: Class, Represents the student details and course registration.
**findStudent:** retrieving or searching for information about a student in a system including looking up a student by its name and ID
**addStudent**: adding a new student to a system or application involving creating a new student object, setting its properties, and adding it to the system.
**printStudents**: Grabs collection of the student class and print information 
﻿**Teacher**: Class, Represents teacher information 
**findTeacher**: retrieving or searching for information about a teacher in a system including looking up a teacher by its name and ID
**addteacher**: adding a new teacher to a system or application involving creating a new teacher object, setting its properties, and adding it to the system.
**printTeachers**: Grabs collection of the teacher class and print information 
﻿**Course**: Class, Represents courses that shows the availability in the school.
**findCourse**: retrieving or searching for information about a course in a system including looking up a course by its name and ID
**addcourse**: adding a new course to a system or application involving creating a new course object, setting its properties, and adding it to the system.
**printCourses**: Grabs collection of the course class and print information 

﻿**Function of the project**
The system functions in a way that:

**1.**﻿﻿Adds new departments, students, courses, and teachers into a system.
﻿**2**Demonstrating existing departments, courses, teachers, and students within a system 
**3**Using primitive data types (char,int, double) and variables to create and generate personal information from the input of the user
﻿﻿**4**8Searching for information on the departments, teachers, courses, and students based on their ID, that involves their names( fname and lname), their credits and other personal information 
**5**Creating a class diagram to furthermore demonstrate the information given by the user
**6**Showing variety in the different classes/methods/fields/constructors( with different return types)
**7**Using different escape sequences and override methods for the school system
**8**Alignment with the material learnt in class(OOP: Object Oriented Programming, Arrays: Enhanced for loop and initialization of arrays,  
**9**Maintenance of code organization 
﻿﻿**10**Assigning/Modifying  a teacher to a course(Ex: modifyCourseTeacher)
**11**Creation/Following  of a clean code structure/standard
**12**Registering a course for a student( Ex: registercourse)
**13**toString (): provides a string representation of an object implementing an Object class that  returns a string that’s overridden (Override)
